                One of my favourite trips was Machu Picchu, a truly majestical place where the Andes spiralled and pierced through the low lying clouds. I was also living in Finland by this time and getting to know the Nordic country. In 2013 I decided to go back to school, this time in Helsinki.</p>

                  <span>the marathon des sables</span></a> and in April 2016 I finally got the chance to participate! Carrying all the food and eqipment needed for the 6 day, 257km event through the Sahara desert truly was an experience to remember. By far the most challenging aspect was the preperation and training, as running in the Finnish winter of -25 was hardly ideal for the +40 Sahara! Number of fingers represent trips taken during the previous night to the toilet!! <br> I also finished my Cambridge AICE diploma from high school and decided to go to university and complete a Master's degree in England.</p>

              It was around this time that I had my first experience in Web Development when I attended a coding bootCamp in Helsinki. Here I was introduced to front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. For the first time in my life I was more worried about 'spacing' between elements on a web page rather than 'spacing' whilst on patrol in some hostile environment! :) <br>
              Following the birth of my Son, I took some time off which brings us to 2021 where I have just completed Codecademy's 
              <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path" target="blank"> <span>Front-end engineer course </span>.</a> It is certainly not easy, but I shall continue to learn, code, and create projects in the future to become a more valuable employee.</p>
